=> Step 1
- Created two folders in locally of the name "project1" and "project2".
- mkdir project1
- mkdir project2
=> Step 2
- Switched to project1
- cd project1
=> Step 3
- Switch to a new branch - 'staging'.
- git branch staging
=> Step 4
- Add a file in it - 'test1' and add content to it 'This is first commit'.
- touch text1.txt
=> Step 5
- Push it to github.
- git push origin master
=> Step 6
- Move to folder project2.
- cd project2
=> Step 7
- Clone the repo in project2.
- git clone git@github.com:Sandeepbidla/test_project.git
=> Step 8
- Switch to staging.
- git checkout staging
=> Step 9
- Change the text in file 'test1' to 'This is second commit'.
- git commit -m "This is second commit"
=> Step 10
- Commit and push to remote branch.
- git push origin master
=> Step 11
- Move to project1
- cd project1
=> Step 12
- Switch to staging branch.
- git checkout staging
=> Step 13
- Change the text in file 'test1' to 'This is third commit'.
- git commit -m "This is third commit"
=> Step 14
- Commit and push to remote branch. (Explain what happened here).
- git push origin staging
=> Step 15
- Switch to master.
- git checkout master
=> Step 16
- Merge staging branch into master.
- git checkout staging.
- git merge master.
=> Step 17
- Create a new branch testing.
- git branch testing
=> Step 18
- Change the text to 'A is an alphabet' and commit.
- touch text.txt
- git commit -m
=> Step 19 
- Repeat the 'step 18' seven times and each time update the alphabet 'A' to 'B' to 'C' etc.(Don't forget to commit the change everytime)
- git commit -m ""
=> Step 20
- Push the branch to github.
- git push origin testing
=> Step 21
- Checkout to master.
- git checkout master.
=> Step 22
- Change the text '1 is a number' and commit.
- touch text2.txt
- git commit -m ""
=> Step 23
- Repeat the 'step 22' seven times and each time update the number '1' to '2' to '3' etc.(Don't forget to commit the change everytime)
- git commit -m
=> Step 24
- Push master branch to github.
- git push origin master
=> Step 25
- Now, rebase testing into master(and don't push the new master and testing branch).
- git checkout testing
- git rebase master
=> Step 26
- Move to project2.
- git checkout master
- cd project2
=> Step 27
- Track testing branch.
- git checkout testing
=> Step 28
- Checkout to master.
- git checkout master
=> Step 29
- Merge branch testing into master.
- git checkout testing 
- git merge master
=> Step 30
- Share your views about the difference between master and testing.
- Master: The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made.
- testing: A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name.
